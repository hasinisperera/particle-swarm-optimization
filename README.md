# particle-swarm-optimization
This is an implementation of the canonical particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve Ackley function.

The Ackley function is an n-dimensional function that has a large number of local minima but only one global minimum. 
It is a typical problem to solve with swarm intelligence algorithms. The function has a global minimum at x = 0 with value = 0.
